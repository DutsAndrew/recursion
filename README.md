# recursion
recursion practice

With this project I was practicing writing recursive functions.

In the Fibonacci files, I have a simple loop function that returns a fibonacci sequence based on the number you give it and a recursive version that does it by calling it's self to break the steps down into simpler and simpler chunks until you can solve the problem.

The Practice file was a 8 question challenge from a website I found. Those were hard to solve and got more difficult the further you went on.

I really enjoyed the merge-sort, I thought it would be confusing, I watched a lot of videos on the merge-sort and the code was easier to write than the videos were explaining it to be.
